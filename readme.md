# Exam Information
## General Information
### The exam completion time will start at 00:00:00 on October 30, 2023, Beijing Time, and end at 23:59:59 on November 12, 2023, Beijing Time.

	### The exam is open-book; reference materials may include textbooks, homework exercises and answers, academic literature, online databases, and web resources. All referenced materials must be clearly cited in the report and code files according to academic standards.
	### Please carefully read the exam task requirements and other related information, download appropriate datasets, process and analyze the relevant data using Python programs, analyze the statistical results with reference to literature and textbooks, and complete the report.
	## How to Complete the Exam
	### All data analysis and plotting must be done using Python code and cannot involve programs including Excel for calculations.
	### You may use spreadsheet programs such as Excel to format and enhance tables presenting your data analysis results.
	### Any familiar tool can be used for Python program development. You can use the Jupyter Notebook or Spyder used in the course or any other Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
	### The report may be written in Chinese or English and should not be less than 3000 Chinese characters or 1500 words (excluding appendices and figure captions). It must comply with academic standards, use academic language, Harvard Style referencing, and follow the style of academic papers, including chapters and paragraphs. The report needs to include three directories: table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables.
	### The report should use the provided cover and correctly fill in the report title, class, student ID, name, and other information.
	## Submission Information
	### Four files need to be submitted before the deadline, ensuring they are the correct versions:
	Report text in .docx or .pdf format, filename: FinalReport_StudentID_Name.docx or FinalReport_StudentID_Name.pdf.
	Code attachment in .ipynb or .py format, filename: Code_StudentID_Name.ipynb or Code_StudentID_Name.py.
	Data analysis attachment in .xlsx format, filename: DataAnalysis_StudentID_Name.xlsx.
	Hard copy of the report.
	### Submit the files through the corresponding entrance on the Chaoxing platform before the deadline. It's advisable to submit at least 30 minutes early to avoid potential network fluctuations causing upload failure.
	### Late submission of any file will result in a deduction of points. For any late submission, each day late will result in a deduction of 10 points, rounded up to a day, with a maximum deduction of 20 points.
	### In case of any exam or system issues, promptly contact the respective course instructor.
	## Grading
	### This exam has a maximum score of 100 and contributes 50% to the total assessment. Subsection scoring details can be found in the task requirements, and grading criteria are available on the report cover.
	# Task Requirements: Financial Data Analysis
	## Data Acquisition, Cleansing, and Descriptive Statistical Analysis (35%)
	### Acquire daily trading data of all stocks in the Chinese stock market from January 1, 2007, to October 27, 2023, including opening price, closing price, high price, low price, trading volume, trading amount, yield, and total market value. (5%)
	### Acquire daily Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) from January 1, 2007, to October 27, 2023. (5%)
  ### Acquire quarterly balance sheet data for all stocks in the Chinese stock market from January 1, 2007, to October 27, 2023, including total owner's equity. (5%)
	### Merge daily SHIBOR data and quarterly total owner's equity data into the stock trading data, removing all entries with null values. (5%)
	### Compute cross-sectional mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values of daily stock yield, trading volume, trading amount, total market value, and SHIBOR yield. Then calculate the time-series mean of these statistics. (5%)
	### Based on the calculated descriptive statistics, provide your analysis of the sample. (10%)
	## CAPM Model (50%)
	### Construct a market portfolio (MKT) weighted by market capitalization, comprising all stocks in the sample with daily total market value as the portfolio weight, and compute daily excess return R_MKT from January 1, 2007, to October 27, 2023, using SHIBOR daily rate as the risk-free rate. (10%)
	### Compute daily excess returns R_i of all stocks from January 1, 2007, to October 27, 2023, using SHIBOR daily rate as the risk-free rate. (10%)
	### For each stock i in the sample, estimate the α and β values using the CAPM model and record the adjusted R-squared value, estimated α value (α ̂_i) and its significance p-value, estimated β value (β ̂_i) and its significance p-value. (10%)
R_(i,t)  = α_i  + β_i R_(MKT,t)  + ϵ_i
	### Choose a stock listed before October 1, 2022, and use the Seaborn library to plot a scatter plot and fitting regression line between its daily excess return R_i and the market portfolio's daily excess return R_MKT. Label the chart appropriately with title, x-axis label, and y-axis label. (5%)
	### Provide your analysis based on the regression results. (15%)
	## Report Format (15%)
	### Set font and paragraph for report titles and text: Use font size 24 in bold for the report title, avoid overly lengthy titles; Use font size 20 in bold for first-level (chapter) numbering and titles; Use font size 16 in bold for second-level (section) numbering and titles; Use font size 12 in bold for third-level (subsection) numbering and titles; Chinese text in the report should use Song (or Kai) font size 12 (English should use Times New Roman size 12); Use 1.5 line spacing with automatic paragraph spacing. (5%)
	### Clearly label and number all figures and tables in the report, design appropriate contents, figure, and table directories. (5%)
	### Provide descriptive text in the report, explaining the names, meanings, and calculation methods of all variables involved in the figures and tables. (5%)
	### Properly cite the sources for all references and materials used in the report and code according to academic standards. (5%)
